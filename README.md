# aes-ecb-vs-cbc
Demonstration of AES encryption modes showing why ECB is insecure and CBC is safer


## Why this matters
Incorrect encryption mode selection (like AES-ECB) can leak sensitive data even when strong algorithms are used. 
This experiment demonstrates how misconfiguration, not weak crypto, causes real-world breaches.
